          <h2>I RELEASE</h2>
          <h3>Affirmations for Letting Go, Lightening Your Spirit & Beginning Again</h3>
          <p class="book-short">I RELEASE is a 30-day guide to letting go of emotional weight, old stories and limiting beliefs. Perfect for anyone closing a chapter, healing internally, or seeking a lighter, more grounded version of themselves.</p>

          <p class="book-full">
            There is a weight you’ve carried for years — some of it yours, some of it never was. There are stories you’ve outgrown, identities you’ve outlived, and patterns that keep pulling you into cycles you’re finally ready to end.<br><br>
            I Release is a 30-day invitation to soften, to breathe, and to let what is heavy finally fall away. Through simple, grounding affirmations paired with gentle reflections, this book guides you toward emotional freedom — the kind that comes from honesty, slowing down, and giving yourself permission to stop carrying what no longer serves you.
          </p>

          <ul class="book-benefits">
            <li>Let go of emotional baggage, self-doubt and hidden tension</li>
            <li>Release relationships, expectations or beliefs that drain your energy</li>
            <li>Make peace with endings and honour your next beginning</li>
            <li>Reconnect with clarity, inner calm and spiritual steadiness</li>
            <li>Create space — mentally, emotionally and spiritually — for something new</li>

          <p class="book-full">
            After you release what no longer belongs, you return to yourself — slowly, honestly, and with a new kind of clarity. I Am is a 30-day journey back to your identity. Back to your voice. Back to the truth you’ve quieted for years: You are already enough. Already whole. Already powerful.<br><br>
            Through grounding affirmations and reflective prompts, this book helps you rebuild from the inside out — not through performance, not through perfection, but through presence and truth.

          <p class="book-full">
            Healing reconnects you to yourself. But choosing — choosing differently, choosing boldly, choosing with intention — is what transforms your life. I Choose is a 30-day practice that helps you step into agency. It’s for the moments you feel hesitant, the crossroads that demand clarity, and the seasons where life is asking you to show up with courage you didn’t know you had.<br><br>
            Each affirmation guides you back to the quiet power of choice — the kind that stops old patterns, ends self-betrayal, and opens the door to a more honest and aligned version of your life.

      <div class="section-text">
        <p>
          I have spent most of my life telling other people’s stories, long before I ever dared to tell my own. 
          From newsrooms to boardrooms to the quiet corners where ideas are born, my work has always asked me to be 
          fully present, to listen beneath the surface, and to meet people where they truly are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mindfulness was never a concept I learned from a book. It was a skill life demanded of me—moment by moment, 
          conversation by conversation, career shift by career shift. It became the anchor that helped me lead, create, 
          evolve, and rebuild every time the world nudged me into a new season.
        </p>

        <p>
          With time, I realised that presence has been my greatest edge in work and in life. The more I learned to slow down, 
          the clearer my decisions became. The more intentional I was, the more aligned my success felt. And the more honest 
          I became with myself, the easier it was to guide others to do the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          This trilogy is my offering to anyone standing at a crossroads or quietly asking life for a reset.
          <strong>Book One, I Release</strong>, is the beginning — a gentle space for letting go and shedding the emotional weight 
          carried for years. <strong>Book Two, I Am</strong>, is the grounding — a return to self, to truth, to identity. 
          <strong>Book Three, I Choose</strong>, is the transformation — where clarity becomes action and intention becomes a way of living.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, these books form a pathway back to yourself. And if you feel called to go deeper — to be guided through your own 
          season of release, remembering, and choosing — I offer coaching spaces for those ready to shift their inner world so their 
          outer world can finally reflect it.

      New Transformational Trilogy by Catherine Mwangi
      <span class="span has-before"></span>
    </h2>

    <p class="section-text">
      Nairobi, Kenya   <br
      Author and storyteller Catherine Mwangi has released a powerful three-part affirmation series designed to guide readers through emotional healing, identity rebuilding, and intentional living. The trilogy — <strong>I Release</strong>, <strong>I Am</strong>, and <strong>I Choose</strong> — offers a 30-day journey through the core stages of personal transformation.
    </p>

    <p class="section-text">
      Each book centres on a pivotal question:<br>
      <em>What must I let go of?</em><br>
      <em>Who am I now?</em><br>
      <em>What life am I choosing going forward?</em>
    </p>

    <p class="section-text">
      Through grounding affirmations and reflective guidance, the series supports readers who are navigating transitions, emotional fatigue, new beginnings, or seasons of self-discovery.
    </p>

    <p class="section-text">
      “These books were written for people who are healing quietly,” says Mwangi. “For those who are shedding old versions of themselves, returning to their truth, and choosing who they want to become.”
    </p>

    <p class="section-text">
      The trilogy is now available for purchase on all major platforms, offering readers a gentle yet powerful pathway back to themselves.
